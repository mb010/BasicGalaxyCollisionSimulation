v09
Supports individual speeds for each of the rings.
Particles are equal in angle spacing along each ring. Equally distributed amongst each ring.

v10
Visualisation data is saved. (and loadable using ploy.py).
Visualisation displays time now, not the number of steps (fluid motion)
Corrected some errors in the math (I believe) See notes on 02/05
Changed the way the step time is calculated.

v11
Radius and speed data output saved
StartPositions now accepts transformations for 1 galaxy.

v12
All transformation variables enabled.
Errors have been brought to my attention in this version. I intend to fix these in the following versions.

v13
Changed loop to be one while loop with a conditional if for (fortran) lines 100-200.
This is after I used pure python in playground to learn that a condition I must employ is: eta<<deltat

v14
Changing output method to use memory views which whose values are set instead of np arrays since this is my biggest bottleneck? (This cant be true)

v15
Using GUI to do analysis - Switching between different graphs (echeck etc.) and sliding graph,
with the ability to select which values one is considering and to output a graph of a specific time into a 3d graphic.

v16
Coloring of individual galaxies as seperate entities
Slider plot with 3d plot instead of 2d slider plot in main body and in GalaxyGUI.py

v17
Removed multithreading.
For the 16 threads, it takes so long to allocate the processes, that it LOSES a lot of time int that process, and therefore takes SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER (specifically on the ryzen system).

v18


vFinal
Has multiple galaxy.py files for multiple calculations which are output differently. 
Fixed pyx file which was allocating the masses of the central bodies in the reverse order, meaning the third galaxy was not the right mass.
